This was the initial, first-generation prototype of the device.
Eagle files are included in pebble-0.1.sch and pebble-0.1.brd, and pebble-0.1-test.pde contains some
simple Arduino code (which is *not* nice Aiko-framework code) to test most of the hardware components.

Only one of these was ever built, and you probably don't want to build one, so detailed documentation,
CAM files, images, and further resources are probably unneccessary.
